# Turing 6502

This respository has the code written for the CSE 40932 final project. The Python code that actually describes the "design" resides in `description.py`. The Python script `simultor.py` runs the basic (and pretty slow) 4-tape TM simulator for the design. The Python script `gen_web_sim.py` rebuilds the JavaScript design files in the `web_sim` folder. The web version of the simulator can be run by downloading that directory and opening `simulator.html` in a web browser. Additionally, a version of this simulator is hosted at [https://b-ingwersen.github.io/demos/turing_6502/simulator.html](https://b-ingwersen.github.io/demos/turing_6502/simulator.html). The file `web_sim/description.txt` also includes the formal definition of the core Turing machine. The other Python files are helper modules for the simulator and the description scripts; they provide the class definitions that generate the final machine description (such as assigning actual codes to microcode operations) as well as autogenerating some of the web simulator files.
